Solutions written in Python.

Benchmark results for the days that I have completed:
| Day | Mean Execution Time (ms) | Min (ms) | Max (ms) | Peak Memory Usage (MB) |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 01 | 17.0 ± 4.7 | 11.4 | 23.3 | 9.37 |
| 02 | 20.9 ± 6.2 | 13.0 | 26.8 | 9.37 |
| 03 | 28.3 ± 6.0 | 20.2 | 36.8 | 10.31 |
| 04 | 45.4 ± 2.9 | 41.6 | 48.2 | 9.06 |
| 05 | 119.0 ± 3.5 | 115.1 | 124.5 | 9.53 |
| 06 | 21997.8 ± 1282.1 | 21176.0 | 24258.1 | 9.84 |
| 07 | 35959.9 ± 318.1 | 35697.8 | 36487.7 | 9.84 |

*Note: I made the benchmark to work with any programming language executed on Linux or WSL using hyperfine and the built-in GNU time command.
