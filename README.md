Benchmark results for the days that I have completed:
| Day | Mean Execution Time (ms) | Min (ms) | Max (ms) | Peak Memory Usage (MB) |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 01 | 19.6 ± 5.1 | 9.8 | 26.7 | 9.53 |
| 02 | 16.3 ± 5.9 | 11.3 | 27.7 | 9.37 |
| 03 | 21.9 ± 4.6 | 16.6 | 30.7 | 10.31 |
| 04 | 42.4 ± 5.5 | 36.8 | 52.9 | 9.21 |
| 05 | 119.4 ± 3.8 | 114.6 | 127.0 | 9.53 |
| 06 | 21710.0 ± 438.4 | 21298.3 | 22474.5 | 10.15 |

*Note: I made the benchmark to work with any programming language executed on Linux or WSL using hyperfine and the built-in GNU time command.
